-rw-rw-r--

- denotes a regular file, then the following triads rw-, rw- and r-- are the permissions for User, Group and Other, respectively

Usage of chmod (change mode)

chmod (ugoa) 			User category user, group, other, all
chmod (ugoa) (+-=)		Add, subtract, or set permissions
chmod (ugoa) (+-=) (rwx)	Read, Write, Execute

e.g. chmod u=rwx fileOrDirectory

The above command sets the current user with r, w and x access to the given fileOrDirectory.

e.g. chmod ugo+w fileOrDirectory

The above command gives all (equivalent to a) write access to the fileOrDirectory

There are also binary and octal based options:

Symbolic 	rwx 	r-x 	r--
Binary 		111 	101 	100
Decimal 	7 	5 	4

Unless otherwise set by the command mask (not described here), the default new file and directory masks are 777 and 666 respectively. That is, all
rwx and all rw- respectively.
