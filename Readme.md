# BashSlide

This program displays slides of very basic Bash commands used in Linux and related systems. The text displayed is stored in TXT files, located in /texts. These files can be edited as desired.

## Usage

Use ./bin/Release/BashSlide

By default, BashSlide looks for text files in the accompanying /text directory, which is located in the same directory as BashSlide. The path and TXT file names can be changed and BashSlide recompiled if needed.

## Source code

The C++ source files can be downloaded from https://github.com/jfspps/BashSlide. The project is released under GPL v2 terms and conditions.
